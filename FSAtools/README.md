Fragment Analysis And Capillary Sequencing Tool Kit
===================================================

Functions to import Applied Biosystems data files and process them in a highly flexible and interfaced framework. RT-MLPA application (gene-expression profiling and classification) is described in Mareschal, Ruminy et al (2015) <doi:10.1016/j.jmoldx.2015.01.007>. Gene-fusion detection is described in Mareschal, Palau et al (under review). Examples are provided for genotyping applications as well.
